# Introduction to Mongo DB - Lab

Those are exercises to do by yourself during the session, with the instructor available for help.

## General instructions

All those queries are to be done using the `sample_airbnb` collection from the Mongo sample datasets.

You'll probably want to open & explore it a bit first before trying to answer the questions.

The queries are progressively more complex, so you may want to solve them in order.

Mongo official documentation is your best handbook here:

- [Queries](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/)
- [Aggregation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/)


## Queries

- Count all results from the collection
